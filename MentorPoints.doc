*Prodcution Ready Application -Ready to use. example - whats Up-- we can use it directly.
    Lot of work has to be done before moving into prodcution like texting, code comprression, Optimization,
    code minimization all thing has to finishe before distaching to user. these all done by using bundlers.
    Ex- Application is 10MB, before moving into it has to be reduced to 5MB or less than that. code is less (Optimization)
    Performance wil be good.

    Bundler - Bundler is developement tool which combines many JS code files into single  one that production ready 
    Loadable into browser.

    *React Inbuild bundler is WebPack.
    * BUndler removes commments in code
    * suppose we have decalred and intialized variable a=10; but nit using in code. so bundler removes it.
    * Modules like import and exoprt, we write a functionmal component but not exported and unsed in code. it
       removes it.

    *Usually in react Creat React App command get all required folder stracture. but we will be knowing how it came 
     and whas the use. so will will learn by manually how to create folder stracture.
    *We use parcel undler in our projects.
    * Study Parcel bundler features. like HMR

    * projects
       *Create Index.html and Index.js files
       *Add cdn links(React and ReactDOM) in HTML(links get it from react official website)
       *React is a open source javascript library user for front end developement.
    *Root Element - We create Root Element so it replaces the HTML data vth React data. 
                   Usually keep div container of HTML is empty.

BUILDING SWIGGY Application

   *Take any big Application there will be a App,Header, Body,Footer- This is basic structure.
     https://i.stack.imgur.com/rvI0H.png
   *App---
       Header----
            logo
            nav items
            home
            about
            cart 
            login
       Body
         REsturant card - Image
                          Name
                          rating
                          cuisine
                          delivery time
                          location

       Footer  
* We can write list of data abt two or 3 resturants but can not able to write for 50 or 100 resturants. 
  manually writuing resturant card is very difficult and time taking.
* so, i will take list of dummy data(resList) then paste into Body component. 
* i will remove all manual data in Body. restList array contanins objects. so i will use map array method in resturant card. 
  Each nad every value of resturant card iterate in each data of an object.
